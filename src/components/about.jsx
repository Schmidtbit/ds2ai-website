                      <p><strong>Hi I'm Andrea Schmidt</strong>, and I am a Data Scientist with a B.S in Industrial Engineering.
                      I help businesses achieve their goals through data-driven intelligence and optimization using statistical
                      analysis and machine learning. I love what I do and I am excited to be exploring new opportunities and challenges
                      as I grow my career in big data. Today, I am writing to tell you the story of how I arrived as a Data Scientist and
                      what makes me a unique candidate and potential hire for your Data Science team.</p>
                      <p>The single most impactful decision I ever made was when I left a job that I loved in order to help my family
                      run their Porcelain Dinnerware distribution business. I was two years into my career as a Packaging Research Sales
                      Engineer, living in Chicago, and traveling the country working with clients to quantify the ROI of investments in
                      packaging safety and process optimization. I was steadily gaining recognition from my colleagues for producing
                      high-quality reports and my work was being well received by our clients. I was even offered a promotion to join the
                      Marketing Research team for a new project launching in Germany. But after the death of my uncle, who was also my
                      father's business partner, I was asked to return home and help run the family business, Schmidt Brands.</p>
                      <p>As Controller of the North American office for Schmidt Brands, I was introduced to the frustration of making
                      business decisions with little or no data. In response, I implemented better documentation techniques and overhauled
                      the bookkeeping system in order to have a better understanding of our finances. In doing so, I was able to identify
                      and eliminate $50,000 of annual wasteful spending, freeing up capital to make more product and inventory investments.
                      It was thrilling to be able to find untapped opportunity through data analysis and this is when I decided I wanted to
                      do more in the field of data analytics. However, I would have to make some changes in order to do so.</p>
                      <p>I moved to Austin, TX in 2016 and in 2018, I graduated from the Data Science Immersive Program at Galvanize where
                      I specialized in developing optimization algorithms and visualizing GIS data using Python. During the program I received
                      hands-on training in modern data analytic tools such as SQL and NoSQL databases, statistical testing methodologies,
                      and machine learning model evaluation. Shortly after, I started working as a Data Science Consultant for an early-stage
                      startup, ELE.ai, educating clients on the Data Science Lifecycle and formulating use-cases and architectures in AI and ML
                      for the retail, health, and insurance industries. During my time at ELE.ai, client retention and engagement increased and
                      we were able to sign multiple new contracts as a white-label AI consulting service. I love what I do but I am still seeking
                      opportunities to work on challenging problems in big data and I hope I will be able to find an opportunity to do so on your team.</p>
